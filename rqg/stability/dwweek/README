Week in the Life of a Data Warehouse
====================================
Migrated from InfiniDB test suite

The test will run continuously until it is stopped.  It does not verify if the test results are correct.  It it used check if the DBMS is stable to run continueously.  It runs the peroformance test suite GroupTest.

Stack Configuration:  Single server

TPCH Schema
All tables have an extra added auto increment column ID.  This is due to the MyRocks requirement of having a primary key column.

Nation
Region
Customer
Orders
Supplier
Part
Partsupp
Lineitem

Note: Only lineitem gets altered during this test

Database size should be adjusted for the target testing platform.  The following is set for a VM with 8gb of memory.

Day 1:

Create TPCH schema in database

Import 1Gb TPCH data

Days 2 and on

7:00AM – 6:00PM (concurrent queries, similating day-users)

	3 Concurrent sessions executing group 200 queries, without time gap
	3 Concurrent sessions executing group 201 queries, 15-second time gap
	4 Concurrent sessions executing group 202 queries, 30-second time gap

6:00PM – Midnight (concurrent queries, similating night reports)
	2 Concurrent sessions executing group 3 queries, without time gap

9:00PM –11:00PM
	“Load data infile…” for lineitem, runs every 15 minutes.  Each LDI loads 10000 rows

Midnight – 7:00AM (single pass)

	Delete rows from lineitem that has been marked with l_linestatus="X"
    select row count from lineitem
    Update lineitem set l_linestatus=’X” for l_orderkey < 100000;
    select row count from lineitem

To setup test
choose a test direcory, which log files will be saved

run: /home/qa/myr/stability/dwweek/sh/initload.sh dwweek

To start test
run: /home/qa/myr/stability/dwweek/testcase/myrocks.sh

To stop test
In the test directory, there is a continue.txt with a digit 1 in it. 
echo 0 > continue.txt
