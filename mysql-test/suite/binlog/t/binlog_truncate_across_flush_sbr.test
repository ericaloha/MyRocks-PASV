# verify that binlog truncation to match engine position works correctly across
# binlog file rotation. On binlog file rotation which is followed by a crash
# before commiting new trx to engine, we should trim everything from the latest
# binlog file. Without this, gtid_executed could show additional trxs that were
# not committed to engine
#
# For example:
# 1. To start with master-bin.000001 is the binlog file which gets rotated
# 2. New trxs are started andmysqld crashes after flushing the trxs to binlog,
# but before committing to engine
# 3. On recovery wngine will say that the binlog file it last saw was
# master-bin.000001. The current binlog file being recovered is
# master-bin.000002 which should be truncated to the beginin of the first gtid
# event in this file
